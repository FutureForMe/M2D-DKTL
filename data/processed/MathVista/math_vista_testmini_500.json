The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

Figure indicates the launch and landing sites and includes a superimposed coordinate system with its origin conveniently located at the launch site. From the video we take the horizontal flight distance as $D=20.0 \\mathrm{~m}$, the flight time as $t=2.50 \\mathrm{~s}$, and the launch angle as $\\theta_0=40.0^{\\circ}$. Find the magnitude of the velocity at launch and at landing.",

Because water vapour is itself a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapour content of the atmosphere is of some concern to climate change experts. Predict the relative increase in water vapour in the atmosphere based on a temperature rises of $2.0 \\mathrm{~K}$, assuming that the relative humidity remains constant.
